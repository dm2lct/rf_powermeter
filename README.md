# rf_powermeter
This is a try to build a rf powermeter for vhf and uhf frequencies. 
It should work with any directional coupler you attach on it. 
Currently I'm still working on it so it should not be rebuilt. 
When I have built and programmed it I will update this repository with the software. 
 
a vhf/uhf swr/powermeter
